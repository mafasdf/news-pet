HONG KONG DEFENDS CURRENCY LINK WITH U.S. DOLLAR Hong Kong has not taken unfairadvantage of its currency's link with the U.S. Dollar, HongKong monetary affairs secretary David Nendick told the annualmeeting of the Asian Development Bank here.    He said: "We have taken the rough with the smooth, having toaccept a downward adjustment of our economy in 1985 following aperiod when the U.S. Dollar was clearly overvalued in worldterms, but benefiting as that currency subsequently declined."He said that since the establishment of the link in 1983, HongKong's trade had been broadly in balance. This year a modestdeficit was expected.    "Under the link, Hong Kong's entirely free and open economycontinues to adjust quickly to any external imbalances, but theburden of adjustment now falls almost entirely on our domesticinterest rates, money supply and price levels," Nendick said.    "The relative volatility in these domestic variables is theprice we pay for the stability of our currency against the U.S.Dollar," he said. REUTER
