GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remainto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <GulfInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said.    The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulfcapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditionalinvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bankaccounts and precious metals.    "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled withmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in thedisclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under threecategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use ofshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region hadfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.    "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a largeextent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loansand bank facilities and very few companies had made use ofstock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stockexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establishexchanges.    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capitalmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capitalmarkets in the region."    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,financial awareness among investors is still lacking andinvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lackdepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s promptedinvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in someGulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adoptfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporationof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.    Azzam said capital market instruments should be madeavailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had beentaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals toown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depthfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain andthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in SaudiArabia.    But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in SaudiArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyaldenominated bond issued in 1978.    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and tradingin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formalexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,Azzam said. REUTER
ZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA Zambia will retain its foreign-exchangeauction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions sinceJanuary 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.    "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't beenabolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.    He said the system would be reintroduced after currenttalks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fundand, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auctionsystem would be used to allocate foreign exchange to privatebidders but not to fix the exchange rate.    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of thegovernment's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation andstrong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossiblefor the government and the private sector, he said.    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. Thekwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.In January 1987 the government was more than two months inarrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, andthe auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchangerate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION The Philippines must devalue the peso ifit wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic PlanningSecretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.    "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exportsmore competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question aboutit. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, SouthKorea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economiesdeliberately undervalued their currencies."    The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It iscurrently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government doesnot intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible andable to continue to respond to market conditions.    Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate fromthe point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher,our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so thefinancing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at itin terms of the economy."    She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.    "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it tobecome uncompetitive because then we are dead."    Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate isa movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmeticthing."    Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pctin calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it wasexpected to touch five pct this year.    He said the government and the International Monetary Fundhad set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.    The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to thedollar when it was floated in 1984. REUTER
FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES CURRENCY REFORMS Former Treasury official C. FredBergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replacethe fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said hadnot worked.    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the majorcountries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which theywould pledge to hold their exchange rates by directintervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary andother policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institutefor International Economics, said in a statement to a HouseBanking subcommittee.    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that hasoccurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and shouldproduce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit thisyear and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," hesaid.

NIGERIAN CURRENCY FIRMS AT LATEST AUCTION The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct againstthe dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding attoday's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 lastweek.    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, fortransactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 lastweek.    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to thecentral bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks aspunishment for inadequate documentation in previoustransactions.    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids arebased on valid commercial transactions and the central bank hascomplained in the past that many are failing to produce theright paperwork within the specified time.

YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA Responsibility for the appreciation ofthe Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley withthose countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter    Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is inthose countries' own long-term interest to raise the value oftheir currencies against the dollar.    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies againstthe dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficitswith Taiwain and Korea.    "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exportsin the short term, but in the long run they have to beconcerned about how they are perceived in the internationalbusiness community," Yeutter said.    For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita tradesurplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, andwith huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defendthe high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in thatcountry.    He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to moveto reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in twoor three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation thatprevails in Taiwan."    Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was notsustainable.    "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threatof U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeuttersaid. Reuter

GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billionmarks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week'ssecurities repurchase agreement, dealers said.    But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.    A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments ofmark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with theBundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System(EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banksbuilt up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billionmarks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time asan earlier securities repurchase pact matured.    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as sixbillion marks.    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman saidyesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to rollover, the possibility that other central banks may choose toredeem them meant a net infusion was needed.    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.    Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over thefirst nine days of March.    Dealers said although the figure was well above an expectedrequirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow offunds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meetthe requirement toward the end of March.

FED SAYS IT SETS TWO BILLION DLRS OF CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AG The Securities and ExchangeCommission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futureson designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges.    The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, toapply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, forapproval of a futures contract on yen bonds.    The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bondfutures contract, a CFTC spokesman said.    The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote,specifically removes a regulation against trading futures ondesignated foreign government debt securities on contractmarkets that are not located in the country that issued thosesecurities.    Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canadaand Great Britain can already be marketed in the United Statesunder a designated exemption issued by the SEC.    But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply tothe CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts onthose securities, SEC officials said.    The new SEC move would also allow those foreign governmentdebt securities to be marketed in the United States bycountries other than those that issued the securities, theofficials said.    Since the foreign government securities underlying thefutures cannot be traded in the United States unless they areregistered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futureswould often take place in the foreign country, the SECofficials said.    The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading ofadditional countries' government securities to be marketed andtraded in the United States, the officials said. Reuter

AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS Central banks have easily beaten backthe foreign exchange market's first test of the industrializednations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.

But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday beforethe G-6 accord.    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economypicked up steam in February at the same time as the West Germaneconomy was regressing.    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gavetraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed theidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bankactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simplytelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about tradingconditions.    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around1.85 marks. "The market was surprised that the Fed showed itsface so soon," said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of Englandintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before theG-6 pact.    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies likethe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor aftertraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuantto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit playson dollar/mark and dollar/yen.    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improvingU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for theincumbent Conservative party in any general election.    "There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterdayand from a peak of about 2.98 recently. "There's been someheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday'sU.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. andBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift intoCanadian and Australian dollars. But here too they werestymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollartoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. centstoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday.    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle suddenupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its nextstep. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to avery tight range against the dollar for several months.    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound longsterling/short mark positions established lately.    "Because of the change in perceptions about the health ofthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operationsare ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said.    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities whohave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australianfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the mostcontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit withJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test ofthe dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market throughthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that itintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.    "Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level inJanuary. But the market has to bear in mind that time marcheson and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount. Reuter
LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL Leading industrial nations will meetagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for nowthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economicgrowth.    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks stronglysuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed thenormally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seemlikely to build on that stability.    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreementlast month was the main reason markets were calm.    But he said in an interview that financial markets alsounderstood, "That all six countries concluded that the measuresto be taken over a period of time in the future should fosterstability of exchange rates around current levels. That is infact what has happened since Paris."    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part bythe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet andcease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, butleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.    The official refused to comment, however, on whether theagreement included a secret pact to consider furthercoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nationshave taken jointly several times in the past year.    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies werewithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economicconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budgetdeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position infuture international talks.    "I think these changes will strengthen the President's handpolitically and the stronger he is politically the better offwe are with the Congress and the better off we are ininternational fora," said the official, an Administrationeconomic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives."    But the official also said the Administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targetEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened tostop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood tohave intervened to curb sterling's strength.    International monetary sources say finance ministers andcentral bankers, who will review market performance and theirown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washingtonjust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund.    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Parispact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April toshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recentlywhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl toldbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates ifthe Fed was ready to follow suit.    A Reagan Administration official said this would show therehad been some change in approach on the part of the centralbank in Germany.    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action bythe Fed and the Bundesbank.    "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talkedabout it, it would no longer be private," said the official, whoasked not to be identified.    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bankis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if themajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinatedaction could be on the April agenda.

TAIWAN SAYS U.S. WANTS TAIWAN DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE The United States wants Taiwan'scurrency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surpluswith the U.S., A senior trade official said.    Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporterson Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last weekthat unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it wouldface retaliation.    Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.Sresponded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile exportquotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus withthe U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.    Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last yearlimiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.    Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pctagainst the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.    It surged last week amid indications Washington was seekinga major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.

ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES Zambia's talks with the World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue packagehave run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, anofficial newspaper said.    The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling UnitedNational Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources assaying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financingfood subsidies and were pressing the government to explain howit proposes to pay for them.    President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidieslast December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the movecaused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riotsin which 15 people were killed.    The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves toquell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost thegovernment about 500 mln kwacha per year.    The Times of Zambia said another major issue in thegovernment's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was theremodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.    The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange tothe private sector has been suspended since the end of January,pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation anddampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.    The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auctionsystem, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, sincethe end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nineper dollar.    Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bankand IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollaron the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.    According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led byassistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to concludeits talks with the government on schedule on March 23.    The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and itstalks with the government have taken longer than expected. REUTER
GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS German banking authorities areweighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in anattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticatedcapital market instruments, banking sources said.    Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options areunder closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they mayresemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. ToJapan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division ofbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-Britishproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.    But banking sources said West Germany was more likely toproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.    "There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latterstages," one representative of the German Banking Association inCologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.    All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, WestGermany's four major banking associations and the FederalBanking Supervisory Office.    Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changeswould require a revision of Germany's credit law, which hasbeen in effect since 1934.    Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.    Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limitedbanks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,on a consolidated basis.    But lending ratios do not extend to several newerinstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currenciesand various innovative types of interest rate hedges.    The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposalslay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swapsthan interest swaps. But even if German banking authoritiesagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree onhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series offormulae for assessing the stream of payments involved inswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financialintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.This is the so-called market-to-market value.    But German authorities are likely to consider this much toocomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule oflending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness ofthe borrowers involved, the sources said.    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extendedto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for publicauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreignbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.    A further complication is that the more flexibledefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May putGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version ofthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.And British authorities, the sources said.    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-datedforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, bebrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despitethe fact that the risk may be entirely different.    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here wasuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status andapplied for a full banking licence over the last two years inorder to lead-manage mark eurobonds.    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lendingratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if theyare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,the sources added.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.    But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.    Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund.    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common," said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system's development.    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system.    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system.    No change in the British government's attitude is expectedbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details. They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change.    "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leode Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.    Economists say the system's fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollarresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, theypredict. REUTER

DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japantakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Parisaccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.    "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of150.00 yen and to fall even below that level," a senior dealerat one leading bank said.    The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable ataround 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at ameeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.    Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewedinflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.    Dealers generally doubted whether any economic packageJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce itstrade surplus significantly, and said such measures wouldprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.    Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package ofmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boostdomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.    But debate on the budget has been delayed by an oppositionboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed impositionof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slimchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the nearfuture, the dealers said.    If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in theU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure onthe dollar, they said.    The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changedsince before the Paris accord, they added.    "Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due toa still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debtcrisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interestpayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of theReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra armsscandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.    "There is a possibility that the dollar may decline toaround 140.00 yen by the end of this year," said Chemical BankTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.    But operators find it hard to push the dollar either wayfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.    Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask forquotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollarwhen it rose to 1.87 marks.    The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in Londonwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.    But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of centralbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's declinebecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buyingintervention as a chance to sell dollars.    However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branchassistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will notshow drastic movement at least to the end of March."    Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see anystrong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their booksfor the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollarwould give Japanese institutional investors paper losses ontheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest inpurchases of U.S. Treasury securities.    U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making anycomments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said. REUTER

ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH Zambia will reintroduce a modifiedforeign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of anew two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor LeonardChivuno said.    Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeksof negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thatthere would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactionsand a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other typesof business.    The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions todistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determinethe kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the endof January.    President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he wassuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluationand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which hadresulted.    Business and banking sources said another reason forsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low onforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successfulbidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction systemwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate ofabout nine kwacha per dollar. REUTER
GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION Finance and economy ministers of theGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting todiscuss further economic integration, officials said.    They said issues to be discussed by the ministers fromBahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bankgovernors on a common currency exchange rate.    The governors agreed in January on a denominator on whichto base currencies of the six states. Any decision will beforwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due inSaudi Arabia late this year.    The six states have different currency systems. SaudiArabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to theInternational Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- thespecial drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.    Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, whileKuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised byitself.

FED'S JOHNSON URGES STRONGER ALLIED GROWTH Federal Reserve Board Vice ChairmanManuel Johnson said that the U.S.'s main industrial partnersshould expand their domestic growth.

ITALIAN PANEL URGES EXCHANGE LIBERALIZATION Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchangecontrols should be "gradual" but also "reasonably rapid," a reportissued by a study committee nominated by the Italian TreasuryMinistry said.   The report, looking at the country's financial developmentprospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growingpublic debt were among the considerations that made a gradualliberalization preferable.    The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pctoscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) duringthe liberalization process in order to lessen short-termdomestic interest rate fluctuations which could result fromportfolio adjustments.    The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantlyhigher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.    Italy has over recent months announced a series ofderegulation moves in response to a European Communitydirective aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods,services and finance by 1992.

TREASURY'S BAKER SUPPORTS FED MONETARY POLICY Treasury Secretary James Baker saidin a newspaper interview that he supports the current course ofFederal Reserve Board monetary policy.    "The course of Fed policy is quite adequate as far as we areconcerned," Baker said in an interview with the New York Times.    In the interview, Baker declined to comment about therecent Paris accord among the six leading industrializeddemocracies when he was asked why the U.S. agreed to stabilizethe dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit arecord level last year.    Baker said in the newspaper interview that it was "a subjectI prefer not to talk about."    He said that if he explained why the U.S. agreed to helpmaintain the dollar at current levels "I would of necessity endup getting into some of the private agreements that supportsuch and agreement" on the dollar.    Baker was optimistic about Brazil, which has stoppedinterest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreigncommercial banks.    "They are, after all, paying on time all the debt serviceand principal on their official debts, having just rescheduledwith the Paris Club," Baker said in the newspaper interview.

BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES The Bank of Finland said it hasstarted dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) withimmediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its ownpaper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.    Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a newsconference the Bank will also limit credits on the call moneymarket from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum creditamount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.    "The recent introduction of three-month money and these newregulations are decreasing the role of the call money marketand the discount rate as monetary instruments," Kullberg said.    Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying thesewere needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bankof Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,they said.    "The central bank for the first time has an instrument withwhich it really can influence the price of money in thiscountry," one banker said.    Under the new rules banks are limited to call money creditsto a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capitaland cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is nowintroduced if the limit is exceeded.    Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetarydepartment said he expected the bank to pursue an active policyon the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.    "We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue thefirst, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think wewill issue at least a few times a week," Korkman told Reuters.    He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with athree-month maturity at first as the market was best developedfor paper of that maturity.    The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-monthcredits and deposits at rates determined by the central bankand the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditionalovernight call money market.    Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from aroundnine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.    On the interbank market there has been an increasing tradein banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. Inaddition, commercial paper accounts for around five billionmarkka and Treasury Bills two billion. REUTER
G-10 FINANCE OFFICIALS DISCUSS DEBT, CURRENCIES Deputy Finance Ministers from the Groupof 10 leading western industrialised countries met here todiscuss the world debt crisis, trade imbalances and currencystability today following last month's Paris monetary accord,sources close to the talks said.    The officials met at the offices of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetarypolicy in preparation for the IMF's interim committee meetingin Washington in April.

NO ZIMBABWE DOLLAR DEVALUATION - CENTRAL BANK Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, the nation'scentral bank, has denied the Zimbabwe dollar would be devalued.

NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA Nigeria's Central Bank has changed therules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analystssee as a means of defending the naira currency, which hasdepreciated steadily.    The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banksbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate theyoffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowestsuccessful bid made at the auction.    This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensurethat they were successful while paying the lower "marginal" rate,analysts said.    "It should act as a brake because banks will know that ifthey bid high they will have to pay what they offered," aWestern diplomat commented.    The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pctsince the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign ExchangeMarket (SFEM), began last September 26.    At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.    "They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way oftrying to stop the trend," the diplomat said.    The Central Bank also announced the auctions would befortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.    It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday'sscheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank wasplanning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offerat each auction.    Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstrippedsupply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus furtherweakening the naira.    If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at thefortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objectiveof the new system, analysts said.    Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, theofficial exchange rate for the naira applying to businesstransactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- thelowest successful bid.    SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustmentprogram, which is considered to be the most ambitious economicrecovery plan in Black Africa.    The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate forthe naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalisingimports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducinginefficient government participation in the economy.    The World Bank has played a prominent part in designingthis dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an oftensceptical public which fears inflation and lower livingstandards.    Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria,said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustmentprogram as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.    "So far so good" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elitewould suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.    Fears that the program would encourage inflation wereincorrect, he said.    Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urbanprices had already reflected the naira's black market valuebefore the currency was allowed to find its true level lastSeptember. REUTER
U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasurysupply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering creditmarket, but at least this week's offerings should provide itwith some focus, economists said.    "Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put towork, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,"said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.    The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package oftwo-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales blockthis week.    The "mini-refunding," which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs innew cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes forauction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes onWednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes onThursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- andsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularlyauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been driftingsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudyU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change inFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has comparedunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place inhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.Equities.    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there aresigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting abit.    "Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,and there is a marked absence of selling," they said in a weeklyreport.    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believesbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week'ssales.    "The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying thesematurities has been wider, it is still positive," he said in aweekly market review.    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generateenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once theoverseas markets have had their run.    "Based on last week's events, there is little to indicatethat the appetite for yield has begun to wane," said economistsat Salomon Brothers Inc.    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investorsare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of thehigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal yearon April 1.    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been bigbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadianmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currenciesshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bondmarkets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven theU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,economists said.    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday withFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound fromJanuary's depressed levels.    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co saidseveral areas, including transport equipment, should havebounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will captotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct afterJanuary's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gainas large as five pct.    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected toshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind theJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while foodprices declined.    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds ratewill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to theapproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass thisweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in thenew statement period beginning on Thursday.    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expectedto open near that level. REUTER

CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT Foreign currency futuresmarkets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countriesagreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band,said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago MercantileExchange's, CME, executive committee.    "The target zone would not affect our market I think atall.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthymarket," Melamed told Reuters in an interview.    "We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with afour pct shift," he said, referring to permitted currencyfluctuations in the early 1970s. "One thing you can adjust is tomake each contract a larger value."    As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumentalin the development of currency futures, which now are crucialto the Chicago exchange.    Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated canapproach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts bygovernments to control currency fluctuations.    "They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, anhour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it'sunrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary."    The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by theexchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stockindex futures contract to the morning from the afternoon wouldhelp eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equitymarkets on so-called "triple-witching" day.    "We think that the settlement in the morning will have asalutary effect so that over a longer period of time I thinkthis issue (triple witching) will go away because of the changein the structure as of next June," when the move is scheduled togo into effect, he said.    Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by tradersof the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future wouldaddress complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.    Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barringbrokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their ownaccount. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged indual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades tothe nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.    The changes "will in time have an extremely positive effecton the marketplace. That's going to prove very, veryinstrumental in increasing volume over time," he said,predicting the increase would come within a year.    Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, saidthe CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limiton the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when theCommodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it couldnot be a temporary program.    The CME also received "many negative comments, many morethan we anticipated," Melamed conceded. Many futures commissionmerchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the eventthe price approached the bottom limit. Reuter
U.K. PROFITTED FROM AUTUMN INTERVENTION - LAWSON Britain has reaped profits by using astronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government lastautumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellorof the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.    He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House(of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reservesin September and October (1986) have subsequently all beenrepurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds."    Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressuresthen for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.The increase in base rates was instead limited then to onepoint.    During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawsonunveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreignexchange market turbulence which followed the somewhatinconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at theend of September, I authorised the Bank of England to interveneunusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that wouldenable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct ratherthan the two pct the market was then pressing for."    He said that that one percentage point increase, effectedin October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two halfpoint cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10pct.    Treasury figures show that the underlying change in Britishreserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of Englandintervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that theauthorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September andOctober 1986, government sources said.

Sumita says Bank of Japan will intervene if n World Bank president Barber Conablepledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lowerworld oil prices, but said further deregulation of itsprotected economy was needed.    Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise theeconomy and deregulate trade policy.    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year whichcut the value of its crude exports in half, is the ThirdWorld's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrsfrom the World Bank in the past 20 years.    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, wasprepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust tolower oil and primary commodity prices.    "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe areconsistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," hesaid.    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after lastyear's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of thedifficulties now faced by other countries.    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against thedollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, andhas announced a series of measures since May intended tostimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalisethe economy.    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plasticsand high tariff barriers remain in place.

SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION Sudan has rejected a demand by theInternational Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation becausesuch a move would have a negative impact on its economy, theofficial Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.    Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said hisgovernment also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidieson basic consumer goods.    SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoumyesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.    Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, issome 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared itineligible for fresh loans in February last year.    In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation ofits pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchangerate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.    Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditorsfor more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluationshad failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollarfor foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.    Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollarwas sold at 5.5 pounds today.    With stringent import regulations and the governmentincreasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollarsare used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouringcountries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.    Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMFand Sudanese government officials do not amount to formaltalks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan'seconomic performance.    The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economicrecovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a seriousattempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuadeits Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.    This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill ofhealth from the IMF that it could take to Western governmentcreditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, toreschedule debt payments.    Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed tomembers of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.    Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMFrepresentative had told him the fund's executive board was "verypleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the pastcouple of months."    The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing DirectorMichel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudanowes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.    Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrsbut set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in thefiscal year ending next June 30. REUTER
FED GOVERNOR SUPPORTS COMMODITY PRICE GUIDE Robert Heller, a member of the Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodityprices could form a useful guide for setting domestic andinternational monetary policy.    Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Hellersaid, "A broadly based commodity price index may be worthexploring" as a guide to monetary policy.    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetarypolicy might be eased," he said.    Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurementproblems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give"early warning" signs of wholesale and retail changes.    "There is no need to react to every small fluctuation incommodity prices or to do so on a daily basis," Heller said in aprepared text.    "But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policyaction might be considered," he said.    Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as anindicator for monetary policy would also contribute tostabilized currency exchange rates.    Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and pricesfor them are more consistent than for other types of goods, hesaid.    He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilizeexport commodity prices for developing countries by using acommodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy. Reuter

BAKER SAYS U.S. WILLING TO COOPERATE TO STABILIZE EXCHAN Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe United States and other nations were willing to cooperateto stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existedat the time of an international agreement last month.    "Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to theParis Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadlyconsistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told aSenate committee.    Baker continued, "We said further that we and others arewilling to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchangerates around those levels."    He referred to a February agreement by six leadingindustrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.    Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan andGermany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economiesfor the United States to support the dollar.    "I will not comment because the foreign exchange marketreads more or less than is intended in my statements," Bakersaid.    Baker said that the other signatories recognized that theymust carry their share of the load of correcting externalimbalances that have hindered the world's economy.    He cited news reports that Germany would increase aproposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks tostimulate domestic growth.    Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures afterthe Japanese budget was made final.    Baker said those nations were stimulating their economiesin a manner consistent with gains against inflation. Reuter

TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT TO FOSTER STABLE CU The shareholders of IllinoisCooperative Futures Co voted to dissolve the 26-year-old firm,the futures trading arm of 85 farm cooperatives, its presidentsaid.    Thomas E. Mulligan, president of the board of directors,said 87 pct of the 61 members voting favored dissolution.    The directors recommended the move, citing falling volumeand higher costs, when it called a special shareholders meetinglast month.    Mulligan said the cooperative would continue operatinguntil April 24, when the member cooperatives will have to beginclearing their futures trades through other companies.    Mulligan said one of the members, Farmers Commodities ofDes Moines, Iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperativeto replace Illinois Coop as a clearing company.    Sources close to Farmers Commodities confirmed its plans,but Hal Richards, president, could not be reached immediatelyfor comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might bewilling to band together.    Industry sources said Farmers Commodities would face adifficult task in setting up a new clearing organization byApril 24, the day Illinois Cooperative will be dissolved.    They would have to obtain commitments from a sufficientnumber of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements,obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms tohandle futures trading.    In the meantime, commercial clearing firms have beencourting the individual coops, trying to obtain their businesswith low trading rates.    If Farmers Commodities is unable to set up a clearingorganization by April 24, individual members will find otherhomes, and they're unlikely to change clearing firms a secondtime, one industry source said.    The demise of Illinois Coop was set in motion by thewithdrawl of Growmark, Inc., the largest member with more than70 pct of the capital stock, according to sources within thecooperative.    Mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that Growmark hadno need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliatedlast year with Archer Daniels Midland.    But he said Illinois Cooperative would still have been ableto meet minimum capital requirements without Growmark.    The vote to dissolve the organization was met with "acertain amount of pang," he said. "But in the final analysis,the decision has to be economic, not emotional." Reuter

The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was veryimportant for the main surplus countries to grow as fast asthey could consistent with low inflation to resolve tradeimbalances.    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volckerhas also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main tradingpartners grow as fast as they can.    Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effectof a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance,takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the tradedeficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement tolower the dollar's value.    He also said improvements in the trade deficit should comefrom other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed outthe administration's package to improve U.S. Competitivenesswas now before Congress.

MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY The monetary authorities of the majorindustrialised countries lost their credibility this week asthe dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers andwidespread central bank intervention, dealers said.    The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month'sParis currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal ofthe success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plazameeting to weaken the dollar, they said.    The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar wasovervalued but this time the market and the authorities are ondifferent sides, dealers said.    Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations hasencouraged the market to challenge the authorities despiteconcerted intervention by the central banks of the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.    Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa foraction to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend bycomments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there wasno target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.    Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Parisaccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman PaulVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to ahalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, theynoted.    The situation has again raised the question of whetherintervention can succeed against the trend in today's hugecurrency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response tointervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.    "This means that the current dollar selling is not of asheer speculative nature but backed by real demand," said KoichiMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite theintervention and it is only a matter of time before someoperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed inTokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its recordlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support torise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Sevenindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.    The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plusItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currenciesapart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could beused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Parisaccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing toprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.Trade deficit, especially with Japan.    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for alower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slowthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, saidTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected largeforward dollar sales from April to June for export billsfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yendepreciation, dealers said.    Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looksineffective in light of this real demand, they said.    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollarsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the newbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said.    "The market seems to have established a new dollar tradingrange between 147 and 149 yen," one dealer said.    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Parisaccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the lowend for the dollar against the yen, he said.    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to145. REUTER

Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.

MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY Treasury Assistant Secretary DavidMulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrialnations is intended to produce "reasonable stability" in exchangemarkets over the next few months.    He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Fivenations and Canada agreed in Paris to "see if there can't be aperiod of reasonable stability instead of volatility" to givetime for the committments in Paris to take place.    Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals.    In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony.    He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.    Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy wasaffected by international developments.    He also said increased Japanese domestic growth wouldresult in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarilylead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Grammasserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.    Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, "I thinkexchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's andJapan's) efforts can be carried out.    Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domesticgrowth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lowerdollar.    Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a patternof higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. tradedeficit.    Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolvedeither through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, bothalternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable. Reuter

GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS The Bundesbank's options for WestGermany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable futureby the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions andemployers, economists and money market dealers said.    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pcttreasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikelyto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely forfear of upsetting the current wage round.    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, "Idon't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whateverhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all itwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the groundfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessmentsof growth and inflation, economists said.    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if theBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in themedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no movethat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, isdemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from thepresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, isoffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and givea two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 thisyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largestunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set thebenchmark for settlements in other industries such as thepublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiationsbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude byearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.    Though many economists said the unions' current warningstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy andwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-weekstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly ontheir positions and there could still be conflict.    This could extend the length of time in which theBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by theprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperativehousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.    "The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put thissquarely onto the account in the negotiations," he said.    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metallunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined thanhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battleto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly insouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hoursyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH andaerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out inwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rateswould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend ona politically-inhibited Bundesbank.    About eight billion marks were coming into the markettomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offerto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customerswas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short ofliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement. REUTER

MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE BRITISH PETROLEUM AND STAND Farm-state Senators indicated theymay broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aidfor borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, aswell as the farm credit system.    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the SenateAgriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, saidlegislation to rescue the financially-troubled system shouldprovide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.    "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers andranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package shouldcover all lenders to agriculture.    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsementsfor the across-the-board approach from the nation's largestfarm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, andfrom the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden thefocus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on howto resurrect the failing system.    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such ascommercial banks and life insurance companies must be includedin the aid package because "it would not be fair to addressonly the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-boardinterest rate or principal buydown did not say how much thebroad approcah would cost.    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa StateUniversity told the hearing the cost could be in the range of3.5 billion dlrs annually. Reuter
FORMER HERSTATT DEALER CAN BE SUED, COURT RULES The former chief currencydealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreignexchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a casefor damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mlnmarks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of overone billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,and led to a tightening of banking regulations.

TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financialofficials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchangecontrols and study the possibility of suspending the controls,a cabinet statement said.    The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy andCentral Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduceTaiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached arecord 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.    Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministryand the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to easethe controls, but he did not give details.    Yu said the government could maintain the framework of theforeign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. Thecontrols would be used during emergency.    Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its tradesurplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billionin 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's tradewith the United States, according to official figures.    But he said that while easing the controls would helpreduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in ashort time.    Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted fromgrowing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largesttrading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.    Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, toldReuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was betterthan never."    Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, saidthe government should rapidly relax its foreign exchangecontrols and open its market wider to help balance trade withits trading partners, especially the United States.    "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchangecontrols will not only help our trading partners, but also helpour own economic problems," he said.    He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boostTaiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. REUTER
OFFICIAL WANTS ARAB FUND TO HELP LEBANESE POUND Lebanese central bank Vice GovernorMeguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arabfund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986.    Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference thebank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.    But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for itswar-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect acommon effort between the central bank and Arab central banksand monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support andpreserve the value of the currency when needed," he said.    Twelve years of civil war have devastated productivesectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade andbudget deficits.    Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded inreducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These areencouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said.    "We believe that with a just political solution acceptableto all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit theLebanese pound and Lebanon."    In the meantime, he said the central bank had four maingoals:    1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit    2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bankfinancing institutions in financing the deficit    3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreigncurrency deposits    4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

CHINA POSTPONES PLAN TO SCRAP PARALLEL CURRENCY Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun saidplans to scrap the country's parallel currency, ForeignExchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due toobjections from foreign businessmen and others.    But Tian told a news conference the Chinese governmentstill considered FECs unsatisfactory.    Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs,Tian said: "We have decided to postpone the question. As towhether it will be done in the future, it will be doneaccording to the evolution of the situation."    He said many people, including foreign businessmen, hadraised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, andadded: "It is rather complicated."    The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners inChina. But they now circulate widely among local residents andthere is a big black market in the currency, though it istheoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency,renminbi.    Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had"many demerits and negative influences."    Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlierthis month that he thought it unlikely that the certificateswould be scrapped this year.    Western diplomats and economists have said the Chineseauthorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative.    Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar pressconference last year that the FECs would be abolished, sayingthe government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable tohave two currencies circulating in China at the same time.

ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY Gulf Arab states must coordinateeconomic policies more closely before moving towards their goalof a unified currency system, the President of the Arab BankersAssociation said.    Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of anArab currency traders meeting: "We have to start withcoordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a commonsystem of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to goyet."    He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be aplausible project.    The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- SaudiArabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates --  have held a series of meetings this year toexamine linking their currencies to a single peg in a systemwhich bankers say could be modelled on the European MonetarySystem (EMS).    At present, five currencies are linked either officially orin practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar ispegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.    A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, intheory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stableexchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at avery low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remainsmall. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in theirinfancy," he said.    Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, apaucity of financial instruments and a legal framework thatoften does not recognise the western banking concept ofinterest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

But the Plaza accorddid not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief thatthe trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. REUTER
BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME Bahrain is introducing a new domesticmoney market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred onthe island's newly launched treasury bill programme.    The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to allcommercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 whichgives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements intreasury bills, or through discounting them.    The circular, released officially to Reuters, said currentarrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer bevalid except "in quite exceptional circumstances."    Under the current system, the agency provides the island's20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-termswaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-termloans secured against government development bonds.    "The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replacethese operations with short-term assistance based on Governmentof Bahrain treasury bills," the circular to banks states.    The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with asimultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at ahigher price which will reflect an interest charge.    The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements willnormally be for a period of seven days.    Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has sinceraised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.    Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and havebeen making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offeredby the agency. But banking sources said the new regime fromApril 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasurybills in case they need funds from the central bank.    Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks holdtreasury bills, although the need by others to take up papercould increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allottedyields slightly.    Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme hadstarted at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.    Banking sources said the cost of liquidity throughrepurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollarswaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity wouldforesake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlyingtreasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord. REUTER

JAPANESE SEEN LIGHTENING U.S. BOND HOLDINGS The dollar's tumble to a record low of144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japaneseinvestors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and isexpected to spur diversification into investment assetsincluding foreign and domestic shares, dealers said.    The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a lowof 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New Yorkfinish, then recovered to 96.20-22.    Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investmenttrusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on theforeign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit'stumble, securities house dealers said.    They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cashpositions resulting from their dollar sales today, and aresidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interestrates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currencytrader said.    The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds willfurther promote diversification into other foreign investments,as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stockmarkets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managerssaid.    They said major Japanese investors in the past two yearsare estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreignportfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct.    Since late last year, Japanese investors, seekingsubstantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used freshfunds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after theParis currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds andgilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, themanagers said.    Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowedinto local bond and stock markets as well.    The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a recordlow of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish andcompared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.    The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points formore than a month here, suggesting most dealers could notsatisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.    A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts inU.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market.The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due tofunds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.    Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the firsthalf of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared withaverage monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of1986, Finance Ministry sources said.    The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitudetowards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct oftotal foreign securities purchased, securities houses managerssaid.    Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed therecord high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said.

CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS One or two large West German bankseffectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity atthe end of the month in order to achieve higher rates fromtheir overnight deposits, money dealers said.    As a result, call money soared in active trading to aroundthe Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday asbanks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.    Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at thecentral bank over the first 29 days of the month.    Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.    To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raiseholdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today andtomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business becausebanks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale ofTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct forthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not returnuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,commanded short-term money requirements of as much as fivebillion marks or so.    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of themonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,draining liquidity for three days. When other banks soughtfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excessfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advancedknowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed itssales of treasury bills on Friday.    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the totalminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbankhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipatethe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.    "(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are notselling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in thisamount," he said. "If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer themarket then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it willbe different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."    But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump inrates, given the delicate state of currency markets.    International central banks have been at pains to prevent adollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmerundertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.    "The whole tender policy is to have a call money of betweenthree and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have todaycannot be very popular," the senior dealer said.    Dealers said the large banks probably achieved averagerates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct orfour pct. This is a higher return than they would have earnedwithout the excessive draining through the treasury billmechanism.    Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiationsbetween Germany's major employers and the unions, theBundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes tomonetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.    Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on theLombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billionmarks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business. REUTER

U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SEES RATE STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe agreement among the industrial countries reached in Parislast month should foster stability of exchange rates at aroundcurrent levels.    In testimony before the House Appropriations Committee,Baker outlined many of the measures taken designed to achievemore balanced growth and a reduction of trade imbalances duringthe Paris meeting.    "These measures should also foster greater stability ofexchange rates around current levels," he said.    Baker reiterated that the ministers at the Paris meetingagreed that their currencies were within ranges "broadlyconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals and thatfurther substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growthand adjustment prospects."    He added: "In these circumstances, we agreed to cooperateclosely to foster stability of exchange rates around currentlevels." Reuter
TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS COOPERATION WORKING Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat the agreement in Paris to cooperate in exchange ratechanges showed that the process of coordination agreed to atthe Tokyo summit was working.    He told the House Appropriations Committee the meeting"demonstrated that the process is working."    He noted that the industrial surplus countries committedthemselves to strengthen their growth prospects while thedeficit countries agreed to reduce their domestic imbalances.    Baker said that for its part, Japan announced a cut in itsdiscount rate to 2.5 pct and committed itself to prepare acomprehensive economic program to stimulate domestic demandafter the Diet completes action on the current budget.    He said the United States must also do its share pressingfor reductions in the federal budget deficit through spendingcuts.    "And we must continue to oppose protectionist pressures,"he added.

TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS U.S. REMAINS PREPARED TO FOSTER EXCHANGE RATE S Arvin Industries Inc said higherinterest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions willproduce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.    Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in thequarter.    These results also reflect the seasonally low sales patternof automotive replacement parts in that period.    Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the secondquarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.    The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,while per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.    Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mlnand earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.    It based these forecasts due to the addition of SchraderAutomotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year.    Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons willnot conform to historical patterns for the year because theacquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in differentquarters.    He said Arvin will complete the purchase of SystemsResearch Laboratories in the second quarter of 1987. This willalso increase revenues. Reuter
TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS U.S. BACKS STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe United States and the five other industrialized nationssigning the recent Paris Accord remain committed to fosteringthe exchange rate at around current levels.    But he declined to comment on what he believed to be anappropriate level of the dollar in world markets.    "I'm not going to comment on that because invariably theexchange markets read either more or less into my remarks thanI might intend," he said in response to a question from theHouse Appropriations Committee.    Baker said the six nations participating in the Parismeeting in February had "acknowledged that the currencies arewithin ranges that are broadly consistent with the economicfundamentals and we and the others as well remain prepared tocooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates aroundthose levels."

BANGEMANN CALLS FOR CURRENCY CALM West German Economics Minister MartinBangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar byboth official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calmwas needed on the foreign exchanges.    Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair,Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities hadleft their mark on exports and investments. He added thatwithout these external difficulties, West Germany's economywould have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pctreported.    Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climatein West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was notin a downtrend.    The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he saidmainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden forsmaller and medium sized firms.    Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steelindustry, which he said had to be fought with all legal meanswhen they did not correspond to European Community guidelineson grants.    He added that in light of the declining demand for steelcapacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government wouldnot successfully be able to stand in the way of any change inthis industry.    Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and calledfor more competition, citing as an example the Federal PostOffice.    The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany,especially as far as deciding who is able to providetelecommunications equipment. REUTER

CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED The surge in currency futures sinceFriday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposedtariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in thecoming week, financial analysts said.    "The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect itto last a little longer," said Craig Sloane, a currency analystwith Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.    Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of somemomentum today, is likely to continue, he said.    Central banks are likely to play a role in halting theadvance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against theJapanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.    Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with hisrefusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a noteof stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.    Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Hornersaid G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force oftheir commitment to the Paris accord.    "I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind thescenes," Horner said.    Horner said more forceful central bank intervention willfirm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.    "Coordinated, punishing intervention" by the central banks-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which hasonly smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according toHorner.    "I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans(currencies)," he said.     On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, whichset a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,is at 0.007050, Horner said.    Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet topeak.    "The basic trend in the currencies is higher," said AnneParker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman BrothersInc. "The market wants to take the dollar lower."    Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over aG-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund could make for choppy priceactivity the remainder of the week, Mills said.    In addition, although the market shrugged off relativelyhealthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators andfactory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger rolein coming sessions, the analysts said.    Friday's employment statistics in particular will beclosely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar. Reuter
U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX The complex task of wielding controlover monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving globaleconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, thenewest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in themaking of monetary policy. But they would be given a muchgreater role under an idea being floated by Governor RobertHeller, who joined the board last August.    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, butargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it wereadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce thevolatility of exchange rates.    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices ofcommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.    His idea, which many conservative economists findappealing, has some backing among board members appointed inrecent years by President Reagan.    It would complement the present system of opening orclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall ofthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead tochanges in interest rates and affect economic activitydirectly.    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity conceptis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetarypolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solidbase.    "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that canserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetarypurposes," says Heller.    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United Stateswent off the gold standard because the global economy hadvastly outstripped gold supplies.    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out ofhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largestproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.    But the current system of floating currencies in whichcurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to themonetary system, is also being widely questioned.    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from aformal approach that mandates intervention by countries whencurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there aremajor problems with this also.    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countriesmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might bedetrimental to their own domestic economy.    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention canmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agreewith the fundamental judgement.    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conferenceto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps themcope with their overpowering debt problems.    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration'schief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-calledGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as aforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and othereconomic matters.   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behindclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from publicposturing.   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have aprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices andinternational exchange rates.    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 majorcommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put togetherand prices would be measured on a regular basis.    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montarypolicy might be eased," he says.    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auctionmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on avirtually continuous basis.    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed andtraded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevancefor the entire world," he says.    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of theproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually allproduction processes.    "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitiveindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,the monetary authorities may take such an index into account inmaking their monetary policy decisions," he says.    However, he says that any major change in a basic commoditysuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action bythe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allowmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodityto the rest of the system and to other commodities. Reuter

NIGERIAN NAIRA FIRMS AFTER RULE CHANGE The Nigerian naira firmed  against thedollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreignexchange auctions at the central bank were changed.    The marginal rate set at today's auction, from whichreporters were barred for the first time since the sessionsbegan last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said.    Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operationfor the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreignexchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at therate of the lowest successful bid.    The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from biddinghigh and thus driving down the naira's value. But bankingsources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchangeremained sharply higher than the available funds.    Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offercompared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.    The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact onbids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared witha top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago.    Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able topass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal ratewill only act as a marker for transactions. REUTER

STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris inFebruary had been successful and would be continued.    Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week'sInternational Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ...Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels hasproven its worth and will also determine future developments."    Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what hewould consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollararound 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.    Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations hadmade it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan majorefforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreigntrade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.    "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, theU.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strongunder-valuation," he said.    Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in aswift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning thecurrent trade dispute over semi-conductors.    Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Pariscurrency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically butnoted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had notbeen published.    The Paris declaration did not state the levels at whichcentral banks of the major industrialised countries wouldintervene.    Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefullyconsidered. He said he had nothing further to add.    Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany wasnow no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government tostimulate its economy.    He declined to respond specifically to a question on thissubject but said, "You must attach particular importance to theconsensus which was reached in Paris."    The minister nevertheless added that he would make clearduring his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal tradefigures gave a false impression about actual trade flows.    Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by anominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct.West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreigncurrency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to arecord trade surplus last year.    However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany'sexports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real importshad risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct.    In this way West Germany had made its contribution toeconomic stability, Stoltenberg added.    Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to riseby a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating.    He said it was too early to revise official forecasts forWest Germany's economic growth this year. The government hasforecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product.    The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is stillexpecting growth of three pct but some other researchinstitutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct.Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how manyimponderables had to be taken into account and said no drasticchanges in official forecasts were needed.

EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT European Community finance ministersand central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discussstrengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuingworries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.    Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host theinformal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bankchiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in thelight of the February agreement among leading industrialisedcountries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.    In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accordbetween the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britainand Canada had proved itself "more or less workable."    But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have beengrowing since fears of a trade war between the United Statesand Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to arecord low against the surging yen early this week.    The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being heldto coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and ThirdWorld debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.    The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the maindiscussions will take place tomorrow.    Continued international currency turbulence could undermineplans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the jointfloat holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuationbands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.    Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period ofcalm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stabledollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to makeit more resilient against exchange rate swings.    The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year asthe falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertaketwo major realignments of parities within nine months.    In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for awide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMSon the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by theEC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central BankGovernors.    The committees were asked to come up with the proposalsafter the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.    Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, thefledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take overthe mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has metwith a cool response in West Germany.    He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would reportto the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalisecapital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, suchas the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.    Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements withoutstrengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation inthe Community.     He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether memberstates were willing to push further towards the EC's goal ofmonetary integration on the basis of an EMS that includedmanagement of exchange rates by some kind of commoninstitution, instead of by national central banks as atpresent.    Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen bythe EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by thereluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove uptheir sovereignty in the monetary field.    EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusalso far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER

U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING A steep drop in goods-producing jobsdetracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makesit unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetarypolicy to defend the dollar, economists said.    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, lessthan the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial marketsexpected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared withFebruary's 50,000 gain, while March construction employmentdropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.    "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as weend the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth inthe second and third quarters."    "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,"he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, butclearly they can't tighten."    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downwardrevision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarterwere weaker than expected.    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the Marchjobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quartergrowth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the averagemonthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.    "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobswere subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fedtightening for exchange-related purposes."    In March, the average workweek fell back to its Januarylevel of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturinghours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturingjobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing.    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted fornearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventoriesresulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up withthe labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as fivepct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales inthe first-quarter GNP accounts.    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise twopct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in thesecond and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrialactivity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinatecontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP."    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gainsin industrial production and personal income for March.They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, forthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pctin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the dropin March construction employment may also signal a drop inMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units inJanuary.    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest levelsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointedout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.    "This just means that there were fewer people looking forwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said.    He said the latest employment report will not concern theFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tightento quickly either."    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonalfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March laborforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated themin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent withhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not thinkthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at theirmeeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined toease," he said. For the time being, however, the Marchemployment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten,regardless of the dollar." Reuter
LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not theonly element standing in the way of full British membership ofthe European Monetary System (EMS).    But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be thestrongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has madeclear she does not expect to consider joining until after thenext UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.    But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters afteran informal European Community finance ministers' meeting herethat other factors apart from the upcoming election stood inthe way of full membership.    In addition to the question of the exchange rates at whichBritain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,there was also the impact of sterling membership on the systemto be considered, he said.    British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar systembased on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterlingsystem, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work."    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that hadmade it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posedless of a problem.    As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearlyweakened," he said.    Lawson restated that the government was keeping thequestion of membership under review. REUTER
EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS European Community (EC)finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need forgreater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System(EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.    "There was a general will to reinforce the European MonetarySystem, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister MarkEyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session ofinformal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.    The gathering was the first such discussion since thesecond major realignment of EMS parities within nine months inJanuary.    The system has come under severe strain as funds haveflowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, sending it soaring againstweaker currencies in the system.    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leadingwestern industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates ataround current levels was working and this would allow the ECto speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of theEMS.    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on theneed for closer coordination among EMS member governments ofinterest rate policies and of interest rate differentialsbetween different countries.    They also agreed they needed better coordination ofexchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, bothwhen they reached their fixed EMS limits and within theiragreed margins.    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range oftechnical problems and ministers would discuss these further inLuxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC'sMonetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economicconvergence betwen Community countries and it was importantthat interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchangerates and inflation rates.    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds thepresidency of the community, made clear the meeting had notproduced any agreement to move radically forward in developingthe EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic andmonetary integration.    "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normalfunctioning of the system," Eyskens said.    Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMShas to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise allmovements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to goahead.    EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told themeeting the authority would put forward proposals for a finalphase of capital market liberalisation in October that wouldinclude safeguard clauses for member countries for which themove would create difficulties.    Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers alsodiscussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS paritiesby letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out bytelephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.    However, West German sources said Bonn Finance MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson toldjournalists that one of the technical issues raised by greatercoordination of exchange market intervention was the questionof which currencies should be used to intervene and held incentral bank reserves.    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS wouldwork better if central banks held each other's currencies -- anissue of particular importance regarding West Germany since theBundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignmentsreflected a general feeling among participants that the way theJanuary reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.   The realignment was marked by acrimony between France andWest Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains inthe system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER
ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION The Zambian currency further depreciatedyesterday at the second auction since the introduction of atwo-tier foreign exchange system last month.    The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to thedollar.    The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction,reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, thegovernment offered eight mln dlrs.    Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of ninekwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket offive currencies, for certain official transactions.    It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auctiononly for parastatal organisations and the private sector, wherethe exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with marketdemand.    The new auction system is designed to be more restrictivethan the previous one, suspended in January after the centralbank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders.    Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oilcompany Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, isallowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchangeon offer. REUTER
U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING U.S. Bond trading is likely to remaincautious in the near term with a possible downward price biasas market participants focus on trends in the dollar, theeconomy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed willkeep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.    Until trends are clearer, "the market can only attempt to toestablish and hold a new trading range at higher interestrates," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthysaid that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthyinvestment climate, the market will have no confidence in thisenvironment until there is illumination of and confidence inU.S. Dollar/trade policy.    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged ifcurrency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseaseconomic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.    "The crucial question, however, is how soon either of thesedevelopments is likely to occur," Kaufman said.    "Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio managerconfidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a whilelonger," said Philip Braverman, chief economist at IrvingSecurities Corp.    However, Braverman said that, "from a longer termperspective, current (bond) prices provide a buyingopportunity."    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday onunexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasurybonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole andThursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a longbond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in asimilar "paroxysm of pessimism," the key bonds reached a similarclosing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring theyield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc saidthat many portfolio managers now believe yields could approachnine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts havespoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher andthey continue to believe that an upward bias is likely topersist over the next few months.    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managerslast week there appeared to be increasing belief that the raterise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct bymidyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.    "Yields could rise further over the next few months, but therise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seensince the start of the year," Held said.    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.    "The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance," saideconomists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push upinterest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollarand head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harmthe fragile U.S. Economic expansion.    The Lanston economists said, "The Fed cannot ease its policystance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calmdomestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat ofcausing a further decline in the dollar."    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policyunchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policylater if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or creditmarkets warranted a policy shift.    However, economists generally believe that continued fairlysluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.Banks resulting from their problem loans to developingcountries rule out any Fed policy firming.    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC atlast Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have littleimpact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due onWednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economicindicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. AFriday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's firstquarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNPgrowth of about three pct if continued through 1987.    Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and areexpected to open about there today with no Fed action seen. REUTER

ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting inWashington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reachedat the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada inGroup of Five (G-5) talks on management of the internationalmonetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.    It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plansto attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyoaccord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.    On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of itsG-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earliersession of talks involving G-5 members.    Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-    "Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it tobe remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for theenlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever "themanagement or the improvement of the international monetaryeconomic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'"    Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on thegrounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubberstamping agreements already taken.    The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was "certain thatthis time incidents would not occur."

FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY Finance ministers from seven majorindustrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilizecurrencies at current levels but said more action was needed toreduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at theU.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said thevalue of the dollar and other currencies was basically correctnow, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese toboost their economy.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called ita "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reportersother ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreignexchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervenedagain to prevent the yen rising too quickly.    The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmedthe commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recentParis meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions willbe essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustainglobal economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's rulingLiberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what thecommunique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" includingan "unprecedented front-end loading of public worksexpenditures."    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven broughttogether ministers and central bank governors of the sevenmajor industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitmenton cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Pariswhen they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at thethen-current levels.    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fallagainst the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases bythe Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading ataround postwar lows.    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the UnitedStates and European countries for its only modest efforts toopen its markets to outside competition and to reduce itsexports.    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to opendomestic markets to foreign goods and services but did notelaborate.

G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmedtheir Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince themarket of their resolve.    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawasaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe atotally new statement was needed.    The speculative selling did not reflect economicfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only areaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, hesaid.    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve hadconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially themark, had remained stable.    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since theParis accord was not worth being called fundamental.    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expressionof 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within therange agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointinga level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,Miyazawa said.    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in thestatement, he said Japan was exceptional among the sevenbecause the yen appreciated against the dollar while othermajor currencies largely have been stable.    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasjusted adoped a package to reflate the economy while othernations are not supposed to produce new measures in a shortperiod since the Paris agreement.    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanesesemiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7meeting and did not affect the currency talks.    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developingcountries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiativeoutlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago. REUTER

U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthat changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly andhave improved the prospects for a reduction in externalimbalances to more sustainable levels.    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making InterimCommittee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement lastnight that the substantial exchange rate changes since thePlaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencieswithin ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally beenorderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction ofexternal imbalances to more sustainable levels."    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strongdomestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closelywith the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doingwhat we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," hesaid.    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund'sexecutive board to review possible modifications to the Fund'scompensatory financing facility before the annual meeting thisfall.    "We should pay particular attention to the lack ofcontinuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFFand to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeedtemporary," he said. Reuter
FRANCE'S BALLADUR SAYS TARGET ZONE NOTION NEARER French Finance Minister EdouardBalladur said that the financial community is closer toarriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite thefact that little is being said about them.

TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS FLOATING EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM NEEDS GREATER S Crude oil netback values in complexrefineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. lastFriday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.    The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularlygasoline, and support from crude oil prices.    Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europerose substantially following strong gains in gasoline pricesthere. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel orthree pct from the previous week.    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.    Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts abarrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fellsharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ampledistillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.    Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.    For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values weremostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts.

TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe floating exchange rate system has not been as effective ashad been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalancesfrom emerging in the global economy.    In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.    "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts."    He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies.    Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today."    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs.    Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic.    "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures," he said.    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for movingbeyond rhetoric to action."    He said they provide "more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination."    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.    "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"he said.    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options."    He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.    "If we are to take effective remedial action when there aresignificant deviations from an intended course, then we musthave more definitive ways of indentifying the right course forkey variables," he said.

SWISS COMMITTED TO JOINT CURRENCY INTERVENTION The Swiss National Bank will continue totake part in concerted intervention on currency markets asnecessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annualmeeting.    He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows whichbore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperationbetween all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent itbreaching thresholds that would damage everyone.    "We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to takepart in concerted intervention to the extent that this ispossible and desirable," Languetin said.    Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction thesix nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures inFebruary, adding that it had anchored the principle ofstrengthened international cooperation.    He said measures such as recent concerted intervention wereuseful in the short term.    But he added, "The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce nolasting effects without a correction of the fundamentalimbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficitand without stronger growth in Europe and Japan."    Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessaryin the "too expansive" monetary policy of the United States,adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supplywas expanding too strongly.    "If this should last long the dollar could only bestabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetarypolicy on the part of the other central banks, which would inturn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation,"he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities inthe most important countries had not relinquished theiranti-inflation policies. REUTER

EMS INTERVENTION SAID SOMETIMES COUNTERPRODUCTIVE Attempts to hold currency ratesrigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary Systemintramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringingfunds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates stillconsidered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.    "The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weakertendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatoryintervention when rates hit band limits," it said in its 1986annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansioncould be caused in the stronger currency nation without itscentral bank being involved in the activity.    "For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as muchroom for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when acurrency is in a phase of weakness," the Bundesbank said.    "In addition, speculative positions are made more expensiveto hold when interest differentials are increased."    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of theextent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention thathas taken place since the foundation of the eight-currencysystem on March 13, 1979.    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS centralbanks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against anotherparticipating unit.    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreementbetween central banks when speculative pressure moves acurrency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet benear any allowed EMS limits.    At the start of this year, central banks were very activelyselling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily theFrench franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it wasceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight toits then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banksbought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginaland 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the totaleventually filtered into the West German monetary system.    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, theBundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in theperiod up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as thedollar surged.

VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Venezuela's central bank has orderedVenezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchangeoperations with brokers based outside the country, according toa copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, haseffectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela'svolatile currency market.    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos HernandezDelfino, manager of the bank's department of internationaloperations.    The telex said the restriction on business with foreignbrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreignexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreigncurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has deniedrumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls toprop up the weakening bolivar.    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a defacto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sensethat there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one brokerhere said.    "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the directionis towards complete control," the broker said.    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all hisVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him sincethe central bank issued the telex and followed it up withtelephone calls.    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volumeof his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrsa day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," hesaid.    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for theprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediarybetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.    "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that'sridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage againstforeigners."    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's centralbank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchangebusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pctreserve requirement.    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading inbolivar futures, the broker said.    "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a smallcurrency it was miraculous."    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current rangeof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly runningout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the freemarket.

POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl isthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who hasplayed a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny forthe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of themark.    President of the powerful and independent West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say.    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)    But no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in West Germany's business community.    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in topministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohlwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his ownChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century.    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.    "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for theBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in West Germany," he told businessjournalists in Frankfurt recently.    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says thatPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.    "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy," she said.    An economist at a German bank, who declined to beidentified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply."    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been topersuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. ForPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was thatthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies.    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.    "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydon't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculator's position worthless.    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf.    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.    "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealersare very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers ofmany people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. REUTER
TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE Taiwan's central bank announced that asfrom today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of localand foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached atthe end of May.    The central bank's statement added that the measure wouldbe effective until the end of July.    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow offoreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. Theyadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plungeof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lendforeign exchange to importers and exporters.    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banksreached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,according to official statistics.    Last week the central bank said that from today it wouldreduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the movewas needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchangemarket.    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbankmarket to avoid exchange rate losses.    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in Mayreached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9billion in April.    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be convertedinto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of boomingexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct inthe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions onremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals toTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value ofthe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs ofspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It hasflowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise theforeign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs oncapital outflows. The central bank has said the controls willbe dropped by the end of July or early August.    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement causedjitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavypurchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank soldabout 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points toclose at 1,803.08. REUTER
KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar depositsheld firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decisionto revive limited funding lines, dealers said.    The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aidwindow through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopenedthe facility for three month money, which was available atseven pct, they said.    It offered one month funds at seven pct through swapfacilities, dealers said.    Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollarsby some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineeredby the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currencyarising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,dealers said.    However, as one dealer noted: "The market is stillunsettled."    Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offersdown to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sellquotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.    Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bidsof 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early9-1/2, 7-1/2.    One month rates were at the same level after trade at eightthen 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct andsix-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reportedoffshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight andone year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.     The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. Thespot dinar was 0.27930/40. REUTER
LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY The Louvre agreement by the Group of Sevenfinance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencieshas worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at theeconomic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said.    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produceany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters workremained to be done on improving the conditions for lastingworld economic growth.side measures to boost growth, he said.    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, butstressed that he had had no indication that such a move waslikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reductionof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavycoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, andhe was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. Maycurrency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playinga very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto."    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement mayfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economiccommitments underlying the accord.    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchangerate stability if countries are seen not to implement theircommitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.Budget deficit was "very important."    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced byJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawsonsaid, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase inmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."    "There is a specific range of consumer and agriculturalgoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which iswholly unjustified," he said.    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japanbashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulationpackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increaseJapanese development aid over the next three years.    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchangemembership would also help deflect criticism, he said.    He said he thought West Germany would instead come underpressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures tojack up faltering economic growth.    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bringforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cutsscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead withthe privatisation of German national industries.    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British planto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries tomake progress in Venice.    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereigndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and WorldBank meetings in Washington earlier this year.    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backingfor the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme wouldbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and ChaseManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debtprovisions.    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the marketresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from thissort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions."They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves todetermine the appropriate size of provisions.    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would bediscussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have topush further." REUTER
LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL The scale of foreign exchange interventionthe Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof ofBritain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreedbetween the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris inFebruary, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawsontold reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange ratestability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if hefavoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billionstg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have beenplaying a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitmentstoward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.    Asked which techniques were available to preservestability, Lawson said both central bank intervention andinterest rate changes could be used to tackle "the marketpressures there are from time to time."    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in thatsense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" bydraining excess sterling liquidity from the market through newissues of government securities and foreign currency sales,when the market allowed.    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,he said.    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Notnecessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawsonsaid. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale." REUTER
NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES Currency futures are likely to movehigher following the sharp rally today after President Reaganannounced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term asFederal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominatedas his replacement, currency analysts said.    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit.    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said.    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said.       "Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff.    "The international community will not like thisappointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner.     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"Horner said.    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7summit, he said.    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said.    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said.    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said.    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothingchanges," Horner said.    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloanesaid European currencies will likely move to the higher end oftheir 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yenfutures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said Septembermarks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swissfrancs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950. Reuter

FED'S SEGER SAYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS SHOWI Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed," Skeoch said.    "There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.    "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. Aslong as that continues we're okay," he added. REUTER

IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in aserious way, Japan investment managers say.    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollarsecurities, have already sold U.S. Equities.    But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happenyesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdrawsignificant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputymanager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd'sinternational investment department.    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japaneseinvestment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest ratedifferentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothingin the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picturefollowing the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effectshould be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiatingto see if the dollar really is stable, he said.

"Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks inNew York yesterday, most are still looking for chances tolighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, managerof Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investmentdepartment said.    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 pointsto 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.

LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS U.S. And West German reaffirmation ofsupport for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamentalproblems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind thecurrent collapse in stock markets, London economists said.    "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that thedollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey ofHoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced totighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in theU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, whichdragged other major markets down with it, may help curb thevery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflationfears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," saidGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments fromother London and Tokyo analysts.    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context ofwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up theirinterest rates," he added.    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fedchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem.    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession.    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists saidtoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind.    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel'sDennis. But he added that markets are still very much indanger.    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing isdisappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said worldmarket turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,as implied by West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currenciesis still on.    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered byexpectations that the Germans were more worried about the moneysupply impact of such intervention than maintaining currencystability.    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, saidMorrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. Tostabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said. Reuter

Miyazawa says G-7 still strongly supports Louvr Monday's stock market collapse couldspell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the WhiteHouse in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a generaleconomic downturn -- political experts said.    "The question is does the stock market (decline) signal animpending recession. If that is the case the Republicans willhave a very difficult time winning," independent politicalanalyst William Schneider told Reuters. "If the Democratsnominate anyone halfway credible they would win," he added.    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point declinein the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected theold political adage that elections are almost always decided byvoters' feelings about their financial well being.    "There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook andwe don't expect 1988 to be any different," says Donald Foley,the top spokesman for Missouri Representative RichardGephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally hasshown amazing resilience and "there's no telling where themarket will be by the end of the week."    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.    "I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the businessindices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy," hetold reporters.    "I don't think anyone should panic because all the economicindicators are solid," he added.    But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knockedthe underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull marketdemonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.    It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argumentfor keeping the White House in their hands when PresidentReagan leaves office in January 1989.    It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice PresidentGeorge Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the WhiteHouse race.    "We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered tobe the strongest in history," Bush said in reference to therecovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment toits highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.    "We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansionin our nation's recorded history," Bush bragged.    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by arecord selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of theeconomy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his newCommerce Secretary, William Verity.    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this monththat unemployment among American workers had fallen to aneight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct ayear ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December1982.    But with interest rates climbing steadily and noimprovement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest ofthe world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubtsabout the staying power of the current expansion.   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been astaple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizationalmeeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economywould be the determining factor in next year's election.    "The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetimeelections are, on economic issues," said Michigan party chairmanRichard Weiner.    "In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where theeconomy is going," added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.    American political history is replete with examples ofvoters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economyturns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat FranklinRoosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years ofRepublican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majorityparty for more than 40 years.    But political experts said that if Monday's stock declineturns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect onthe 1988 election.    "Times change, conditions change," Schneider said.    Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, Schneideradded, "Never make predictions, especially about the future." Reuter

G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in theLouvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollarfree-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,economists and currency traders said.    "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks upin an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of thedollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.       In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretaryJames Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West Germanmoney market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact tofoster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped sendthe already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into atailspin.    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen.

TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS The Louvre accord on currency stability,which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets sincelast February, appeared in serious danger today as atransatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came tothe boil, foreign exchange dealers said.    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock andbond markets plunged, officials in the major industrialcountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problembetween the United States and West Germany and insisted thatthe currency pact was still alive.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the marketfears when he attacked the rise in West German short-terminterest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of whatwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He wasreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Groupof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed thepact.    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who bothhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economicgrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvreagreement was still operative, the West German interest ratemove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker thathe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all betsare off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currencyanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguineview, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparentlyreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Bakercomment will regret it later on."    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted theLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers torespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithfuland firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to theLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the BritishTreasury commented on the row.    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despiteU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this doesnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of theLouvre Accord."    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executiveof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said thatfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.Was still committed to the accord.    In a move which the market interpreted as a possiblegesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-termliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct onMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injectedmedium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France alsostepped into the French money market to hold down rates,injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates roseclose to eight pct. Reuter
