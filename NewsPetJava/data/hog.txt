NPPC APPEAL ON CANADIAN PORK DISMISSED The U.S. Court of International Trade hasupheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extendcountervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include porkproducts, the National Pork Producers' Council said.    The court's ruling came in an appeal to the TradeCommission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.    Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed bythe court ruling and said the council will accelerateactivities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Actthat would address the objections outlined in the TradeCommission's ruling.    The Commission had said there was insufficient economicintegration between the pork production industry and the porkpacking industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs tofresh, chilled or frozen pork.    The legislation has already passed the House ofRepresentatives and recently passed the Senate FinanceCommittee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senateby the end of the summer.    An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the currentcountervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. belifted is pending before the Court. Reuter
